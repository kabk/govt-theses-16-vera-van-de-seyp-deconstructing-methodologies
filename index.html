			This discourse is composed around the concept of deconstruction, as first introduced by philosopher Jacques Derrida. His theory is connected to the hacking culture that has been expanding rapidly over the last century. Over time, the hackers' ethic has taken a prominent position: a never-exceeding urge for a high-level, passionate play and an attempt to consciously exceed limitations of existing tools and frameworks. 
			 <br>

			These principles of play and exceeding limitations can be applied to design, too. As graphic design seems to be on a crossroad, many new forms of design have been made in the last decade. In some new forms of design, hackers ethic has been a fundamental basis for the experimental approach and innovative outcome of the work. Design dealing with experimentation and exceeding limits of tools can roughly be split up in to physical, digital and conceptual works. These three orientations will be discussed and explained with fitting examples. 
			<br>
			The tendency of design that seeks a next level and exceeds the existing boundaries, has socio-economical, political and creative consequences for the field. Showing the current consequences and influences, it is shown to what extent the hackers ethic could be primordial for the future advancement of design. 
			<br>
			Towards the end of the discourse, opinions of designers that work accordingly to the hackers ethic will be pointed out through an interview. The piece will conclude with a vision of the writer.
