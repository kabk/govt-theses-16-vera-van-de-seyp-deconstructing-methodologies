In 2010, Douglas Rushkoff wrote a book he titled Program or be programmed—ten commandments for the digital age. <a id="ref-75" id="#75"></a> In his book, he explains how he sees programming as the new literacy of our times. As more activities are happening online or on-screen, many important events occur in this new language. He regards literacy as a combination of reading and writing, in this case, code.
	<br><table></table>According to Rushkoff, the literacy of society evolved accordingly to the development of their media: first, there was the spoken word, then there was written text, then there was the printing press and then the computer with which we can program—but ‘we’ is actually not all of us. Around the time of the rise of written text such as bibles, a great many people were not able to read, so people went to church to listen to the clergy. When the printing press printed books, people gradually began to read more. The rise in the rate of literacy has taken centuries and was not significant until the establishment of a state school system much later. Nevertheless, the free flow of information created a more informed public and therefore could dismantle the Church monopoly of knowledge. However, even then only a small elite became writers or printers. Now, as literacy is a human right <a id="ref-76" id="#76"></a>, all write text, blog, tweet, post, mail, and app. Yet many people do not know how to program. 
	<br><table></table>The majority commonly was on the receiving end of the medium that was the newest état de l’art, one step behind on the current abstraction of the media. Rushkoff insists that programming is an even more significant development than the printing press; it is at least as important as written text. <a id="ref-77" id="#77"></a> Just like previous media transmitted influential content to the people, just as in the West Christianity and Protestantism did, programming should be doing a similar job.

<subtitle><br>Subjectivity</subtitle>
Nowadays it is important for all people to be able to feel contempt for the biases of platforms and media that they use, in order to understand the rules of the game. For instance, people that use Apple’s cloud system—the place where all personal files are stored—, often don’t realise how this new structure makes them more dependent on a system than if they save their files locally. The Cloud is frequently thought of as content floating around in the air, whereas it in fact is a global network of energy-sucking, steaming server farms. Sadly, it is common to not comprehend the biases that programs and systems include. 
	<br><table></table>A piece of code has a contextual background – whether corporate, political or otherwise. A clear, recent example of subjectivity of code is the North Korean operating system that leaked out. As one of the most isolated countries in the world, its communist citizens “are being brainwashed”.<a id="ref-78" id="#78"></a> The operating system (OS) that was recently found, showed how something considered objective was programmed to constantly monitor the user. The OS thus constantly followed the citizens’ every move, leaving no privacy to them while using a computer. The West were appalled at the news, and the media covered the story with a strong tone of reproof. <a id="ref-79" id="#79"></a> Who says that it is just the case for North Korea? It may be an extreme example, but the limitations in software constitute an omnipresent, continuous process in many more cases. 	
	<br><table></table>The fact that Western society reacted with such a great shock, reveals the paradigm of our own conviction that surveillance in OSs is abnormal, and that in the West this type of monitoring is not the case. This reaction is incongruent, for it painfully shows that the common public fails to recognise the many similar ways of monitoring and tagging in Western operating systems and networks. Some kinds of monitoring, most people know but “don’t care” about, “because everybody is using it” and “I have nothing to hide”. (Ironically, the latter argument has its own Wikipedia page. <a id="ref-80" id="#80"></a>) The PRISM scandal in 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked information about the CIA’s surveillance program that collected internet communications in the USA, revealed that Western network infrastructures are not waterproof. <a id="ref-81" id="#81"></a> Society takes a certain objectivity of code for granted that in many cases does not exist. Western OSs include many cases dangerously similar to the North Korean example, yet a large part of society seems to fail to acknowledge it. 

<subtitle><br>Responsibility</subtitle>
It is not always true that major companies can be relied on; therefore it is one must always stay critical about one’s environment. According to the deconstruction theory of French postmodern philosopher Jacques Derrida, objectivity can never be accomplished. <a id="ref-82" id="#82"></a> Supposed objectivity in truth can be deconstructed, although truth never has objectivity. <a id="ref-83" id="#83"></a> Truth can be told from the inner workings of networks, not from the spokesmen that try to sell them to you. 
<br><table></table>Code is subjective and contains such biases, but these are also sustained by underlying factors. The problem of surveillance and power structures has a broad, fundamental base that keeps it securely rooted in its place. It is not only in the code of the program or website itself, but it also has to do with the physical structure which they were built on top of. Many networks are physically located in a centralised cloud. And it is not even illegal! The fact that by using a network, one agrees with the storage of data on one of the companies’ servers <a id="ref-84" id="#84"></a> is sneakily—intentionally—hidden in long, unstructured texts with a baffling jargon. “The usage and all data about this usage of a commonly visited website such as Google may be processed and saved at server farms on another continent. How long it is stored and what happens in the meantime is not clarified.” <a id="ref-85" id="#85"></a>, the Google Privacy Policy says. Such influential companies can do so because they have the resources, acclaim and physical circumstances to do so. 
	<br><table></table>From the way that Rushkoff describes code literacy and the events that happen on programmer’s level, two conclusions can be drawn. First of all, it is rather useful to understand code in order to understand what is going on. Obviously it is not everybody’s task to program whole operating systems, but it is clear that code is a powerful language that can have a lot of impact. 
	<br><table></table>Secondly, there is a gap between the way that new media are used and the lack of acknowledgement of these uses. As code is the new international literacy, it is in fact a new medium, but a hidden one. For the sake of human rights, keeping an ethical code in this realm should be seriously pursued. Paradoxically, the group of people with the most moralistic view on code is one that is seen as digital pirates, hackers. <a id="ref-86" id="#86"></a> 
	<br><table></table>Designers that want to change the world, resist the authority of state or be critical, go ahead and start learning your share of code. From previous examples, it is clear that code is a powerful language that can have a lot of impact. Design might not be as influential as vast software and hardware networks, but it can help a great deal. To do so in an ethical manner—to help others or to solve problems—is something that not only designers can be held responsible for, but (curious) humans in general.
	
<subtitle><br>Design as interface</subtitle>
The interface is a surface of contact between two adjacent elements. <a id="ref-87" id="#87"></a> If one considers the screen as interface, there are multiple surfaces of contact to be distinguished.
	<br><table></table>The first is the physical hardware of the screen. Electricity runs through the network, reaches the screen, which in turn translates binaries to light up the LEDs in the grid. The second layer of interface is the digital system that constructs the rules for interaction: which action of a user undertakes which consequence on the screen. The third is the graphical layout of the content shown on the screen. <a id="ref-88" id="#88"></a>
<br><table></table>Design has little to do with the first two types of interface of the screen, yet the third type fits exceptionally well to its capabilities. Design as a conductor of graphical literacy can explain abstract information through a vocabulary of form, layout and interaction. As a non-verbal language, graphical literacy is based on the understanding and creation of significant form. <a id="ref-89" id="#89"></a> Next to that, design involves text processing and rules of typography. According to dual-coding theory, information is easier to retain and retrieve when it is coded both verbally and visually. <a id="ref-90" id="#90"></a>
<br><table></table>Therefore, design can create accessibility of the screen with its knowledge about form. The graphical and typographical principles of design function as interface between the computer and the user. On top of that graphical language subjective, as the one writing inevitably passes something more than neutrality. Design can have an influence on encoding levels of literacy that are not directly perceivable as a visual artifact. There is the question of how the world looks as a screen, and another, more important, is how we look as objects of perception from the position of the machines with which we co-occupy that world. <a id="ref-91" id="#91"></a> Graphical design thus allows communicating through the graphical layout of screens on multiple levels. 
	
<br><table></table>Code literacy allows the designer to control his share of impact. Combined with graphical literacy, design have the power to shape the (digital) environment on which we spend most of our time, for the rest of our lives. What do we want that environment to be like? We are the designers, and the builders. We can decide how we want to use the voice we have. 

<quote>“If Mark Twain were visualizing such a big problem in society, or if it were Jorge Luis Borges, what would that look like? It sure wouldn’t be a “get the largest data base and collect absolutely all the data” and things like that. Instead it would be a “How can I meet people where they are and wrap it in a way that tells a story?”</quote> — Ben Fry, creator of Processing <a id="ref-91" id="#92"></a>
