<subtitle> hungry, stay foolish </subtitle>
The first time humans went to the moon and made a photo of the whole earth from space, it was published in a magazine called </i>The Whole Earth Catalog</i>. In 1973 the very last page of the final issue of the magazine said <i>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</i>, with a picture of an early morning country road. <a id="ref-29" href="29"></a> The almost proverbial sentence is an ode to human curiosity. It can literally be associated with a hungry human, looking for new means to feed himself in order to survive. 
<br><table></table><i>Stay Hungry</i> relates to humans’ instinctive response to craving. Metaphorically, it refers to a craving for something other than nutritious goods. It hints at the inner motivation to hunt, to search, to exceed; to never be satisfied and always look for more. The second part, <i>... Stay Foolish</i>, is an allusion to impulsiveness and rejection of logical advice. Foolishness is the mindset of the <i>Homo Ludens</i>, an image of man as a playing being formulated by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga. <a id="ref-30" href="30"></a> The Homo Ludens is a being free from worries, who is always playing and enjoying his life. Huizinga argues that everything that we name ‘culture’ comes from play, and develops as such. Once play becomes suppressed, culture cannot grow. Reward, freedom and satisfaction of primary needs of the self are the most important basis to maintain play and thus a flourishing culture. According to Huizinga, play stimulates culture.
	<br><table></table><i>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</i> was once referred to by Apple CEO Steve Jobs in a 2005 speech at Stanford University, USA. Apple is known as a company that combines technology with smooth design and simplicity, and Steve Jobs was Apple’s guru. Although he was referring to <a id="ref-31" href="31"></a> <a id="ref-32" href="32"></a> the first appearance of the metaphor, it often was mainly attributed to him and Apple.  <a id="ref-33" href="33"></a> <a id="ref-34" href="34"></a> <a id="ref-35" href="35"></a>
	Innovation is the genesis of a new, more apt idea, product or process. <a id="ref-36" href="36"></a> Apple is an innovative company because they effectively market the products they bring out in a combination of components that has never been done, resulting in immense acclaim of the brand. In a way, Steve Jobs made a link between “Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”, his company and innovation. <a id="ref-37" href="37"></a> However, before becoming the innovative leader of Apple as a centrepiece of the Silicon Valley dream, Steve Jobs was part of a completely different kind of community. He was a hacker. 

<subtitle>A brief history of hacking </subtitle>
If you think about a hacker, you probably envision a Hollywoodesque image of a pale nerd wearing a smudgy hoody and sitting in a dark, dirty, cave surrounded with zooming processors and blinking LEDs. I know you do. 
<br><table></table>And that’s fine, because it is a commonly known form of hacking. However, the verb “to hack” means so much more than breaking into computer systems. As used as “hacking” a system, the word we know derives from a verb that first appeared in English around the 13th century, meaning, “cutting with heavy blows in an irregular or random fashion <a id="ref-38" href="38"></a>”. Another possible definition of the word comes from “hackney” – a horse or car for rent –, referring to somebody who does unimportant work. <a id="ref-39" href="39"></a> Hackney also signifies a pastoral area nearby London, where horses were kept. <a id="ref-40" href="40"></a>
	<br><table></table>The first appearance where “hack” was connoted to messing around with machines was at MIT in April 1955. In the minutes was written, “Mr. Eccles requests that anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn the power off to avoid fuse blowing.” <a id="ref-41" href="41"></a>
	The MIT being an influential institute around that time <a id="ref-42" href="42"></a>, the ‘hacking’ gained popularity of its use at the institute in the mid-20th century. Its significance initially non-technological, the students used the word to say “mischief pulled off under a cloak of secrecy or misdirection”. <a id="ref-43" href="43"></a> It was a term applied to the pranks that MIT students pulled. 
	<br><table></table>A traditional MIT prank from the early 1930s was executed by Ken Wadleigh and four others. By distracting the conductor and setting off thermite bombs, they welded a Massachusetts street trolley to its metal rails. <a id="ref-44" href="44"></a> The computer clubs at the Institute used the word to praise a member for a successful alteration that he had made in an existing system. “Hacker” was a positive term for somebody with great skills, who could push programs beyond what they were designed to do. Richard Stallman, a significant figure for open source technology, defines hacking as “Playfully doing something difficult.” 

<subtitle>The hacker ethic</subtitle>
In the 1960s two members of Homebrew Computer Club in California started developing something that they called “blue boxes”. These blue boxes secretly were devices used to hack into the phone system. The members, who identified with the code names “Berkeley Blue” (Steve Jobs) and “Oak Toebark” (Steve Wozniak), later went on to found Apple Computer. Oak Toebark,—Wozniak for acquaintances, or ‘one of the people who built the first personal computer’ for others—claimed that “the computer itself is entertainment”, and explained how a considerable amount of features of the Apple computer came from one of the games they developed. The majority of fun features that were built in had only a function in one of their projects, which was to program a game called ‘Breakout’ and show it off to their friends. <a id="ref-45" href="45"></a> Steve (the Oak one) saw the programming experimentation he did as some sort of game. It is not an uncommon perspective in the hacking culture: for many people it is a joyful, exciting exploration. Solving computational problems arouses a strong feeling of curiosity in the hacker and makes him (or her) thirsty for more. To find the limitations of the system and to exceed them is a true adventure. When Sarah Flannery, an Irish hacker, was sixteen, she described her work on the “Cayley-Purser” encryption algorithm: “I had a great feeling of excitement... Worked constantly for whole days on end, and it was exhilarating. There were times when I never wanted to stop.” <a id="ref-46" href="46"></a> Many hackers are known to not sleep or eat for full days because of their fascination.  

<subtitle>Open source movement</subtitle>
The term “open source” in connection with software was first proposed by Christine Peterson, American nanotechnologist and a member of the Free Software Movement (FSM). <a id="ref-47" href="47"></a> Founded in 1983 by Richard Stallman, the FSM has the goal to obtain and guarantee certain freedoms of software, namely the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies of it. <a id="ref-48" href="48"></a> Previously Stallman had created an operating system and free software movement called GNU, the name of which is a recursive acronym meaning GNU’s Not Unix: it is both a tribute to the operating system Unix and shows that GNU is something more, namely freedom. <a id="ref-49" href="49"></a> The movements’ philosophy is that the use of computers should not lead to preventing people from cooperating with each other by software restrictions.
	<br><table></table>Every reform movement has a lunatic fringe. <a id="ref-50" href="50"></a> Whereas all views are ideological in the FSM, philosophies on software freedom differed, as well as terminology. Two fervent antagonists were Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond. <a id="ref-51" href="51"></a>
<br><table></table>Stallman believes that proprietary software is legal, but immoral. Using proprietary software causes side-effects, makes people feel helpless and at the mercy of external companies. Free software—he makes a distinction between open source software and free software —is a natural consequence of the basic structure of information, computers and software, and is ultimately moral. Anybody can modify free software, share it and customise it. 	
	<br><table></table>Raymond’s view is a bit less ideological as he states that proprietary software is not illegitimate, but economically problematic. The system of sharing Open Source software—for he is one of those people that make no distinction—can be legally strengthened with Copyleft licenses. Proprietary software is not immoral, but risky. “To do the Unix philosophy right, you have to be loyal to excellence. You have to believe that software is a craft worth all the intelligence and passion you can muster... Software design and implementation should be a joyous art, and a kind of high-level play. If this attitude seems preposterous or vaguely embarrassing to you, stop and think; ask yourself what you’ve forgotten. Why do you design software instead of doing something else to make money or pass the time? You must have thought software was worthy of your passions once ...” <a id="ref-52" href="52"></a> This states exactly what the hacker ethic and open source is about. Hackers are serious about their play and what they are playing with, too. <a id="ref-53" href="53"></a> They want to bring their project to a higher level, want to share, and need to think beyond the limitations put on them. Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world, McKenzie Wark states in his Hacker Manifesto. <a id="ref-54" href="54"></a> Open source is their software ideology.

<subtitle>Open design </subtitle>
In 1998 Dr. Sepehr Kiani, a mechanical engineer at MIT, realised that the structure of open source could be beneficial for designers too. Together with his colleagues Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh, he set up an Open Design Definition. <a id="ref-55" href="55"></a> It contains guidelines for free (re)distribution, inclusion of a design documentation, modification and derived works. Around the same time that Dr. Kiani came up with the idea, Reinoud Lambers of the TU Delft launched his “Open Design Circuits” website, where he proposed a hardware design community in the spirit of free software. <a id="ref-56" href="56"></a> “Open Design” as a name was coined by Israeli designer Ronen Kadushin in his 2004 thesis, and the term was formalised in his 2010 Open Design Manifesto. <a id="ref-57" href="57"></a> It officially means a form of co-creation where users contribute to the design of the final product, rather than a private company. 
	<br><table></table>This envisions that everybody, also non-designers, can use and contribute to a project. It is a system for the development of physical products, machines and systems through the use of publicly shared design information. <a id="ref-58" href="58"></a> Generally, it functions by the same principles as the open source movement. 
	<br><table></table>The phenomenon of open source software and design is related to a much wider societal development. The sharing economy, peer-production (also known as crowd sourcing or mass collaboration) and other proposals of post-capitalistic systems seem to become cultural dominants. <a id="ref-59" href="59"></a> The popularity of these models over more traditional ones offers a perspective on a likely architecture of society in the future.
	In the design realm, both concepts of distribution seem to be successful. Both ‘opens’ have a different effect on the working methodology of the designer. Open source allows a designer to build on the shoulders of giants—being able to use pieces of code as a basis, save time and educate—however, a basic programming knowledge is definitely needed. Open design attempts to break the exclusivity of the design field and opening it up to anybody with a computer. 
	<br><table></table>An example of an open design project is The Free Universal Construction Kit of Golan Levin, a new media artist and professor at the Carnegie Mellon University, USA. <a id="ref-60" href="60"></a> <a id="ref-61" href="61"></a> While building a toy car with his child, his skilfully engineered Lego components did not match the K’nexx ones, which made him extremely furious. The blocks of each brand were designed to the millimetre to fit their own brand, but the systems of connection wouldn’t fit on any other. He recognised that the standardisation of these building toys offered the solution at the same time. Levin designed and printed 3D blocks fitting the block of one brand at the left and another at the right side, which functioned so well that he created connectors for a load of other toy brands too. He even created a universal component, The Universal Adapter Brick, which is capable of fitting 16 brands of building toys to each other. He open-sourced the designs, so that people anywhere can access them and have less frustration while building. Levin argues that all artistic work should be open sourced, since culture is a dialogue where the one responds to the other. <a id="ref-62" href="62"></a>
	<br><table></table>Sharing makes it much easier to create something that is beyond the limitations of the designer’s power and influence—since it is in reality made by more than one person. This raises questions of authorship: who is the person who is formally making a work?

<subtitle>Copy Right </subtitle>
Ownership in the design realm is an intricate issue. Graphic design was never a discipline of mechanic innovation and thus cannot be patented. Other options to protect a work are copyright and trademark licenses. Copyright protects the original expression of ideas, but not the ideas themselves. <a id="ref-63" href="63"></a> It is possible to Trademark a smell, letter, number slogan, logo or a combination of these, but not an idea. If there were a distinction between the form (style) and the idea (concept) of the identity of a product, instances of design seem to not be legally recognised as a mode of production that results in original creation. <a id="ref-64" href="64"></a> A design concept is thus not protected by law and could not be, since functional design should be able to communicate the concept to the public. 
	<br><table></table>To hypothetically comprehend a design concept argues for the possibility of copying. It would be much harder to hypothetically comprehend the functioning of a mechanical engine, and furthermore its functionality does not include its complete comprehension. For a designer, the step to open source a design is thus a more obvious one, because design already was open in the way that information is shared, even from the perspective of jurisdiction. The designer can be the author, but never the owner.
	Nonetheless, to allow the public to freely copy an exact work makes it even easier to reproduce, and this is what open design pursues. The authorship in traditional design makes room for collaborative forms of creation, where copyright is irrelevant.

<subtitle>Copy Left</subtitle>
With open design, new models of property licensing develop. Open source code or software falls under a larger category of software that is called freeware, types of software that are free. <a id="ref-65" href="65"></a> Freeware licences do not cover the same properties as copyright licenses—on the contrary, for open source they often indicate the exact opposite. The licenses of open source fall under a category called Copyleft and permit the user to reproduce, adapt and distribute the work, as long as the work stays open source under the same license it started with. Copyleft licenses are a segment of the legal system of existing copyright laws, which order to secure the free availability of a work. <a id="ref-66" href="66"></a> There are approximately 30 different models of Copyleft licenses, yet the GPL, Beerware, and the MIT License are used most often. <a id="ref-67" href="67"></a>
	<br><table></table>The GPL, GNU General Public License, was the first popular copyleft license, again created by Richard Stallman. <a id="ref-68" href="68"></a> It states that a core of a program can be used as a library and included in a project without having to open up the code – though the owner encourages users to share anyway. If the user decides to make changes in the core, he needs to submit the changed code back to the owner. The GPL is often used as a reference of compatibility for other licenses. The Beerware license gives the user practically all possible freedom, but encourages him or her to buy the creator of the script a beer if they considered the software useful and happen to meet in real life—away from the keyboard. <a id="ref-69" href="69"></a> <a id="ref-70" href="70"></a> The MIT License gives one the right to deal with software without limitations—the software can even be sold—but the license has to be included. <a id="ref-71" href="71"></a>
	<br><table></table>Obviously, all the licenses mentioned above are constructed in response to copyright, and defend opposite norms. In a way, copyleft licenses are their own paradox: a legal disclaimer stating that content is entirely free and adaptable for anybody; to protect the content from being protected. They thus strongly bear the ideology of open source gurus like Stallman: that everything should be protected from the proprietary industry – who are in their eyes purely malicious. Regardless of their ideological stance, the open source movement can be seen as an incentive, a medium and an epitome of a shift away from the author as an individual, for it unites people around the world by accommodating their collaboration. According to the copyleft models, these forms of collaborations can shape whatever they want, as long as they cultivate openness.

<subtitle>Authorship of tools</subtitle>
In his essay Who is the Author, Lev Manovich argues the following about collaboration of a designer and a piece of software: “The author sets up some general rules but s/he has no control over the concrete details of the work – these emerge as a result of the interactions of the rules. More generally, we can say that all authorship that uses electronic and computer tools is a collaboration between the author and these tools that make possible certain creative operations and certain ways of thinking while discouraging others. Of course humans have designed these tools, so it would be more precise to say that the author who uses electronic/ software tools engages in a dialog with the software designers.” <a id="ref-72" href="72"></a>
<br><table></table>Manovich describes that an author that works with a piece of software engages in a form of collaboration with it that limits the authors potential and influence to a certain extent. Of course, the author sets the rules, but in the end the software—or tool —defines the concrete outcome. As software often is a one-way communication (the software communicates, the designer does not), it is not an equal form of collaboration. 
<br><table></table>Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York once said to his friend Marshall McLuhan: “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”. <a id="ref-73" href="73"></a> Objects create a new environment, change the perspective on the world, and gradually become an extension of man. To approach computers from McLuhan’s perspective, the computer as a tool is an extension of the mind. By discovering the possibilities of a program, people can think of new types of ideas. Next to that, they can automate tasks to solve problems quicker. Our mindset changes according to what we work with.
	<br><table></table>Following McLuhan’s’ way of thinking, digital product designer Wilson Miner explains how the 20th century in the USA  was largely defined by the car. <a id="ref-74" href="74"></a> The car, as an extension of man, allowed people to travel further and faster. The infrastructure that was built around the car shaped the modern USA, with its suburban areas and transcontinental highways. Concurrently, oil platforms, factories and gas stations were constructed. The American car thus had a massive impact on people, the country, the environment and the world. Miner anticipates that the 21st century is going to be defined by displays in a similar way as the car did for last century. According to him, whatever goes on screens will have a huge impact on our society. He proclaims that designers play an important role as their expertise is visual storytelling and ordering information into understandable forms. 
	<br><table></table>If designers manage to combine appealing storytelling with shaping influential, digital platforms, the consequences could be very powerful. Software used by designers would be a resourceful tool to give shape. In order to fully be in control of this creation, the limitations that are the product of software use, as Manovich described, should be surpassed. To succeed, the designer needs thus to be in control of his software or other tools. Therefore, to play a significant role in the current age, designers must understand the tools that they are dealing with.
