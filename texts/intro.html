It is the developing of tools that distinguishes humans from monkeys. The earliest humans evolved more than 2,8 million years ago--being the first species of which evidence of the use of tools has been proven. <a href="1"></a> Tools are the extension of man: they make up a part of who we became as human beings. 
Since the popularisation of new media, graphic design has been in an identity crisis, split up between traditional and modern methodologies. The design profession has shifted from designing a specific medium to finding a way to show a message in the best way possible. Its significance lies in translating raw content, whether a written manuscript or a database, into an understandable form. <a href="2"></a> No matter what that content is, this core essence of design remains. 
Now hereâ€™s the problem. The content is changing: stories are constructed from new resources, such as databases and dynamic information. Messages are displayed on different types of media. These are all new tools. An essential aspect of our practice is the translation that is being made from content to form. The way we translate to a form may change accordingly to the content itself. In my opinion, this is our greatest talent. We can give meaning by ordering and editing. And this leads me to formulate my main question.

Why is it important for designers to surpass the limitations of their tools by learning how to program?

To determine the answer to this question, my research focuses on the following topics. In the first chapter, the history of graphic design, discussions about the current discipline, the unicorn myth, cognition and craftsmanship are clarified. The second chapter elaborates on the relation between innovation, the hacker ethic, open source and authorship in the current age. The third chapter unfolds in an explanation of the importance of code literacy in relation to subjectivity and social responsibility. Finally, the answer to the question above can be found in the conclusion.
